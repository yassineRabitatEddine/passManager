A basic password manager to better use your passwords.
It encrypts (Not done yet) the passwords, then stores it in a database.
It also provides users management, controlling access to its services by authenticating users using passwords (Access passwords are hashed then stored into a database).

NOTE that this solution is not safe for use and it's for testing purposes only ! Don't use it for your passwords, but use a verified password manager instead.
